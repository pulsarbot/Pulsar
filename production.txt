	/!\ WARNING /!\

	PulsarTS supports running on production Linux servers only!
	
	INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS (Linux only):
		1. Install NPM and NodeJS (Debian/Ubuntu/Mint/ETC: "apt install nodejs npm" Fedora/RedHat/CentOS: "yum install nodejs npm")
		2. Install TypeScript globally (npm install -g typescript)
		3. Install PM2 globally (npm install -g pm2)
		5. Run "prod-init.sh" to generate the log folder (optional, as the daemon run script eventually runs this anyways)
		6. Run "tsc" to generate the JavaScript files
		
	TO START THE BOT:
		Run "npm run-script prod-run" to run the repository as a daemon
		
	TO STOP THE BOT: 
		Run "npm run-script prod-stop" to kill the daemon
		OR
		Run "pm2 delete PulsarTS" to kill all daemons by that name
		
	TO LIST ACTIVE DAEMONS:
		Run "pm2 list" to see all of the currently running daemons
		
	TO CLEANUP OLD DAEMONS:
